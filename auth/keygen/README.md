# Keygen #

Uses the Keygen.sh authentication and licensing system to handle authentication into moodle.

This plugin handles authentication for users within the KeyGen licensing system. Where the plugin checks if the user exists in the database and whether they have a vlid license that matches the product we are looking for here.

It should also handle generating generic users within Moodle and populating their name and email information for continued use.
